# Congressional-App-Challenge-2022
Describe what your app does.
In recent times, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and initiatives to be more environmentally conscious have become topics of much prevalence in the media. 
Each of these challenges demand more attention, and become more pressing by the day. 
The Restock Tracker is a web-based app that is designed to tackle these problems through small initiatives. 
To get started, every user must create an account on the app. 
Then, users enter basic information about the product in the ‘Product Entry’ tab. 
In the ‘Product View’ tab, the entered products can be viewed. 
This tab also displays the day that the product is predicted to finish. 
Three days prior to the completion of the product, The Restock Tracker will send a notification to the user alerting them that their commodity is near its completion. 
After replenishing their stocks of the product, users navigate to the ‘Product Edit’ tab and mark that they have restocked the product. 
Products that are no longer in use can also be removed from the records via the ‘Product Edit’ tab. 
By informing users shortly before their product finishes, The Restock Tracker alleviates users from the task of having to remember what commodities that they are in need of. 
Additionally, in setting a predicted finishing date, the Restock Tracker encourages users to be mindful of their consumption rate. 
This not only helps save money, but it is less costly on the environment. These small initiatives to be conscious of one’s lifestyle not only help one, but also the community that surrounds one.  





What inspired you to create this app?
In the years of the pandemic, there were various problems, touching many aspects of life. 
One such issue regards inflation and supply chain disruptions. 
It is estimated that the price of the average cleaning supply has gone up by 28% between 2007 and 2021. 
Overall the prices have increased by 8.2% across most of America due to inflation. 
Making small initiatives to keep tabs on lifestyle can help one navigate through these times of trouble. 
The Restock Tracker was designed to help one keep an account of different products in their household, when they run out, and when to buy a replacement for the commodity. 
My goal with this app is to help users, including myself, have a better understanding of my product consumption. 
In creating a comparison point between how much of a certain commodity I should use, and how much I actually use, I have a better understanding of the areas regarding consumption that I need to improve on. 
This helps combat the overconsumption of products, saving both money and the environment. 
Additionally, the advance notification enables one to determine and better plan shopping trips. 
This allows one to avail of the deals that offer the best price, thus, helping one save money without interfering too much with one’s lifestyle. 
These small initiatives, I envisioned, help make life more convenient, while encouraging a more financial awareness. 
These goals compelled me to create The Restock Tracker, an app that helps and encourages users to be mindful of their needs.

What technical difficulties did you encounter while programming your app?
The Restock Tracker uses four different programming languages, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and Python. 
These three languages each have their own benefits and their pitfalls. 
However, being able to use these languages in tandem was a struggle. 
I started making this app by drawing out a flow chart of events. 
This would help me determine what language certain parts of the app should be written in. 
However, even with this measure, piecing together the different aspects of the app was challenging. 
Timing different operations, storing data, and passing information from one file to another was a major struggle during the creation of this app. 
Working hard and overcoming this struggle was a major accomplishment, a milestone in the development of this app. 


What improvement would you make if you were to create a 2.0 version of your app?
The primary purpose of The Restock tracker is to ensure timely reordering of the commonly used products, by informing users of when their products run out. 
This app lets a user know when to restock a product, while giving the time to determine the best store to purchase the product. 
One feature that I would like to add to The Restock Tracker is a further sophisticated notification system. 
Currently, this system checks to see how close a product is running out at a set point in time. 
However, this may not always be the most convenient, nor effective notification system. 
In a future version, I envision that The Restock Tracker will track a user’s location and send them a notification when the user is at a store. 
This in-the-moment reminder will be more impactful in terms of remembering a product for a user.
This will make The Restock Tracker also function as a purchase list in addition to the convenient, interactive log of all of the commodities that one needs.
